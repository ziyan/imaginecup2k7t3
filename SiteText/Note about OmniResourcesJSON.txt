IMPORTANT NOTE: The extension of the file is .csv, but in reality in Excel the appropriate file type is:
  Unicode text (.txt)

For translation purposes:
* Adding new rows to the existing OmniResourcesJSON.csv file works fine.
* Clicking Save in Excel with the file open works fine. The file type should show as Unicode text.
* Converting the file to a true Excel spreadsheet (.XLS) should work fine.
! Changing the file dropdown to Comma Separated Values (CSV) will NOT work. All unicode text will be lost, which defeats the point of translating.
